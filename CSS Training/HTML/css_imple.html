            Srinivasa Ramanujan, (born December 22, 1887, Erode, India—died
            April 26, 1920, Kumbakonam), Indian mathematician whose
            contributions to the theory of numbers include pioneering
            discoveries of the properties of the partition function. When he was
            15 years old, he obtained a copy of George Shoobridge Carr’s
            Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics, 2
            vol. (1880–86). This collection of thousands of theorems, many
            presented with only the briefest of proofs and with no material
            newer than 1860, aroused his genius. Having verified the results in
            Carr’s book, Ramanujan went beyond it, developing his own theorems
            and ideas. In 1903 he secured a scholarship to the University of
            Madras but lost it the following year because he neglected all other
            studies in pursuit of mathematics.

            Ramanujan continued his work, without employment and living in the
            poorest circumstances. After marrying in 1909 he began a search for
            permanent employment that culminated in an interview with a
            government official, Ramachandra Rao. Impressed by Ramanujan’s
            mathematical prowess, Rao supported his research for a time, but
            Ramanujan, unwilling to exist on charity, obtained a clerical post
            with the Madras Port Trust.

            In 1911 Ramanujan published the first of his papers in the Journal
            of the Indian Mathematical Society. His genius slowly gained
            recognition, and in 1913 he began a correspondence with the British
            mathematician Godfrey H. Hardy that led to a special scholarship
            from the University of Madras and a grant from Trinity College,
            Cambridge. Overcoming his religious objections, Ramanujan traveled
            to England in 1914, where Hardy tutored him and collaborated with
            him in some research.
